# csvtojson
csv to json converter assignment on edx introduction to nodejs course

Issues  
* At first attempt I named the repo csvtojson and tried to install the `csvtojson` module. Npm complained so I changed my project name.
* After `csvtojson` converted the input csv file to json, I had to do a JSON.stringify() before writing the output json to disk. 
* Code linting is a great idea by the way. I was using `xo` but found that `standard` fits my style better.

Meta  
* I'm using `standard` for code linting
